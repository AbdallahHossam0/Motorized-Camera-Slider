# Motorized-Camera-Slider
## An AVR project to control a camera on a slider using a stepper motor.

We want to control a stepper motor connecting to a camera by a potentiometer to specify the speed of the stepper motor and a push button to control if the stepper motor is on or off.

We also will use another push button to set the motor direction (clock wise (Forward), anti clock wise (Reverse)).

The speed of the motor selected by the potentiometer will be displayed on the LCD (2 x 16 character) also the sate of the motor will be displayed (On - Off) and the direction (Reverse - Forward).
